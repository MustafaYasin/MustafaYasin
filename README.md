## Hi, I'm Mustafa 👋

A graduate computer science student at LMU Munich and ETH Zurich. After graduating with a degree in Mechatronics in 2018, I spent a year abroad at the University of Technology Sydney and Peking University.

- 🎓 I'm a Student Assistant at [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/)
- 🔭 I'm currently a Working Student at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other engineers.
- 🥅 2022 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects.
- 😅 Fun fact: After high school, I took a year off and traveled around Europe, where I learned a lot and was able to broaden my horizons. During this year, I worked as a sneaker seller.
